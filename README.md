# ANN and CNN Project

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

### Steps
- **Import Dependencies**
- **Load Data:**
   - Utilize the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling).
- **Feature Engineering:**
   - Apply Standard Scaling for feature normalization.
- **Training DataSet:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Feature Scaling:**
   - Implement feature scaling to normalize independent variables.
- **Create Neural Network:**
   - Construct the Artificial Neural Network for churn prediction.
- **Initialize ANN:**
   - Set up the initial structure and parameters of the ANN.
- **Add Layers:**
   - Configure the layers of the neural network for optimal performance.
- **Train Model:**
   - Utilize the training dataset to train the ANN model.
- **Measure Accuracy:**
   - Assess model accuracy using the [accuracy_score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html) metric from scikit-learn.
  
**Result:** The model has achieved an accuracy of 87%.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

### Steps
- **Import Dependencies**
- **Download and Prepare the CIFAR10 Dataset**
- **Verify the Data**
- **Create the Convolutional Base**
   - Add Dense layers on top.
   - Compile and train the model.
- **Evaluate the Model**
   - Test Accuracy.

**Result:** The model has achieved an accuracy of 87%.
